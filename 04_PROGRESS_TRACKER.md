## 🎯 Current Active Sprint: Android Application & WireGuard VPN Remote Control
1. **Task 1 (Completed ✅):** WireGuard VPN Remote Control Architecture Integration:
   * Replaced Cloud Bridge (Vercel Serverless / Redis queue) with direct WireGuard VPN peer-to-peer tunnel architecture (`http://10.14.0.1/cgi-bin/api`).
   * Created automated OpenWrt router setup script [`router/setup_wireguard.sh`](file:///Users/sabbir/Dev/wifi_handler/router/setup_wireguard.sh) (165 lines, <= 250 mandate enforced, generates keys, configures UCI network & firewall, outputs `.conf` and terminal QR code via `qrencode`).
   * Updated `DashboardConnectionBanner` with ChaCha20-Poly1305 WireGuard tunnel diagnostics.
   * Updated Settings Sheet with WireGuard VPN Gateway management and connectivity test (`🟢 Reachable`).
   * Removed cloud telemetry polling from `router/sync.sh`.
2. **Task 2 (Completed ✅):** Android Application Deep Polish & Live Emulator Verification:
   * Built and installed production release APK (`app-arm64-v8a-release.apk`) on live Android Emulator (`emulator-5554`, Android 16 API 36).
   * Verified all 5 navigation screens (Dashboard, Devices, Wireless, Network, Advanced).
   * Implemented interactive "Client Tunnel Profile (.conf)" modal with 1-tap clipboard copy in `WireguardVpnCard`.
   * Captured live screenshots verifying Cyber-Dark UI, telemetry, and WireGuard profile modal.
3. **Task 3 (Completed ✅):** Test Suite Synchronization & Production Build:
   * 100% test pass rate across Flutter tests (`flutter test`: 95/95 passed).
   * 0 errors / 0 warnings in static analysis (`flutter analyze`).
   * 10/10 test suites passed in `router/test_api.sh` with strict <= 250 lines compliance.
   * Compiled optimized release APKs with `--split-per-abi` (`app-arm64-v8a-release.apk`, `app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk`, `app-x86_64-release.apk`).
